       "\"teacher are punctual but they should also give us the some practical knowledge other than theortical Good  Excellent lectures are delivered by teachers and all teachers are very punctual. Good teachers give us all the information required to improve the performance. Yes good and punctual It is good Good Good It's good when compare with my Btech lectures and teaching activities. Good way of teaching is good University teaching here is very much dependent upon slides,though it is a easy way of teaching but still leaving some concepts unclear..otherwise interaction with the faculty is good.Lecture delivery sometimes is not upto the mark and punctuality is  fine.  Good Good  As compared to other colleges and university our university is perfect in all the aspects Good Lectures helps in clear our concept Talk about punctuality, it's really good but the lecture delivery is somehow not appreciated because every teacher has different style of teaching, so lack of knowledge in terms of subject is there and interaction is also kind of boring. A teacher should be entertaining as well but they are really not. All they want us to be studios and disciplined which is really not the thinking of every student. University is very good at delivering proper lectures,also the interaction with students is descent. Sometimes the teachers lack in terms of punctuality but overall university is giving a good input.  Good Good lecturer are punctual and can interact them easily. Good Good Punctuality is good. Most of the teachers are not interacting with students . Good nice lecture delivery is not so good It's good Discipline, punctuality , lecture delivery all are good but hv to do some work for quality of lecture Interaction is very good,accurate supplement material is provided but recommendation of books is very poor,the change of a particular teacher after 3 months or a semester of same subject causes problems Perfect It is really gud Very good teaching and management but too much load on student and working hours in terms of lecture delivery that is good.in terms of punctuality that is also good but in terms of intraction that is very bad. There are some teachers they donot interact and do not litsn our problms that means they do not coprate. According to me everything is going well in accordance to interaction.More than enough is served.  Very good teaching and management but too much load on student and working hours not effective and satisfactory in terms of lecture delivery by all the faculty . Good Good Accurate It's good Good it is good depending on the faculty maintained punctuality, good lecture delivery average average good good good good average good it is quite good , depending on teacher and their experience it is quite good , depends upon teacher and their experience the way of teaching is good but the time more than enough good teaching delivery good, teacher is delivery the lecture in the best way they can good and qualified teachers but few lacks in interaction with students and fails to describe a topic average very good teaching facilities, lecture given are fruitful and teachers are punctual interaction is good but not with mostly male lecturers.punctuality is maintained by everyone but lecture delivery not peak quality. all things are good all things are good all activties are good all activties are good good All is good. no other university is so serious about the concept of practicals. lecture delivery depends on teacher's knowledge, punctuality is good Good way of teaching is average not so good average good the staff is highly punctual ad interactive and encourage students to participate in the class staff and faculty members are always available for interaction, very punctual and delivery of lecture can be improved good delivery good our university is good in terms of lecture delivery,interaction and punctuality good very good good interaction satisfied, lecture delivery good,punctuality always on time Excellent but it depends upon teacher good good Good good Good Good  very good. it is ok some teachers aren't doing their jobs in very well manner Some of the teachers are not well experienced but they are interactive and helpful and punctual. not all the teachers are teaching well but it's fine EXCELLENT The faculty is good ,interaction between student and teacher is also good not good Good Good some of our faculty member are not so experienced that's why most of the time we are facing problems subjects like CSE(c++) good its to good  everything is good but when coming to some lectures who dont have a good grip on subject,they dont behave well with students and they dont even teach all the concepts in the subject.  excellent everything was good regarding to university but, some lecturers don't have grip on the subject and lag in the teaching normal good good teaching activities of our university is good. i am satisfied with it. GOOD everything is good for faculty satisfactory GOOD all are good good but not good . sir improve the subject The university is good but it also has a long way to go. More teachers should have their PhD and college fests related to academic curriculum must be improved to a great extent and must be managed properly.The interaction is good, lecture delivery needs more lucidity. The punctuality is top notch. our university is good in punctuality,lecture delivery but it is not good in terms of interaction average interaction is very less ,when it comes to lecture delivery its fine but the co cordination not there between the lectueres good All lectures are giving their best to teach the students our university is very good but in terms of interaction of teachers wd students is not at all fair because they interact wd only students understands his/her teaching they don't make remaining students to understand the topic  The university consists of a whole world in itself.It is diverse and manages to conduct all events properly.I love being the part of this university where we get equal and all opportunities in all respects and fields. teachers are pretty interactive,But it all depends on the student to gain as much as knowledge he can from the teacher.Teachers are punctual and very helpful during exams time. teaching delivery is good .but it is better to reduce there speed of  lecture delivery to understand the student better overall rating on this activity is 4.5/5 .very nice teaching and interaction between students and lectures was good, every time there will be new and fresh style in  delivering the lectures ,thanks.\\n\\n\\n  excellent, but reduse the speed of teaching  ,up to understand the students teaching is ok but the interaction with the students need to improve, i mean they have to focus on dull students more  than intelligents.... Interaction is good but it should b more ...rest is too perfect teachers are good in subject,and punctuality Everything would be fine if there are less number of students in our btech CSE. good  faculties are doing quite well but need more senior lecturers. satisfied Well and Good Good good university management is extordinary but some of the faculty is very bad good good good some lectures are excellent,but not everyone It is very good learning in this university its  booring good Good teaching is good but some lecturers are showing partiality between south people and north people excellent teaching is good but some teachers are not able to interact properly and are not able to clear the concepts properly, teachers are punctual. \\n good good I am very much satisfied with teaching faculty interms of iteraction,lecture delivery, punctuality etc they are showing partiality between north indians and south indians good Interaction is satisfying, Lecture delivery is Good, Punctuality is Excellent\\n\\n staff is showing partiality between north indians and south indians  excellent university  the mode of teaching is completely different than any other university in india. lecturers are very friendly with every one they interact just like friends and they are very punctual lecture delivery and punctuality was good but the interaction with students was not good. punctuality and lecture is good here but interaction isn't good. good enough In this university there is good interaction with the students, Teachers in this university can deliver the lectures effectively, There is good punctuality in this university\\n\\n Very good indeed.  Teaching is excellent,but lecture delivery is not up to the mark.Punctuality is good interaction of some faculty was good but not all faculty.. good, and also like the teaching style Interaction between students and teachers is good ,The lectures delivery is fine, punctuality is good\\n \\n\\n not bad Its Quite Good very good indeed not bad.. teaching is good some lecturers are showing partiality between south people and north people I WAS A STUDENT OF A BOARDING SCHOOL .....(jnv) I STUDIED FOR 7  YEARS THERE RESIDING IN HOSTEL ..NOW LIVING IN LPU IS SAME LIKE THAT..AND STILL MORE SAME AND PUNCTUALITY IS SHOWN HERE BY BOTH TEACHERS AND STUDENTS...AND ALSO BY THE STAFF..
